If you want to discuss my paper
 [The Pattern Basis Approach to Circuit Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05331),
 see [this post](https://oresmus.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/pattern-basis-approach)
 on my math blog:
 [https://oresmus.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/pattern-basis-approach](https://oresmus.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/pattern-basis-approach)

(The present blog is mainly about software-related ideas.
 For math, a wordpress blog seems more useful,
 since comments can be in LaTeX
 and lots of mathematicians are registered there.
 You're *allowed* to comment on this page, but for this post I don't recommend it.)
