<h3>Employment:</h3>

<p><b>personal projects</b> 
(2009 - present; see also <a href="http://oresmus.github.io/">blog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oresmus">github</a>):<ul>
<li> proposal for a "graph of all ideas", <a href="http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2015/09/21/social-net-for-ideas.html">Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks</a>, and its implementation as a "<a href="http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/OPSN-data-formats.html">shared cloud</a>" </li>
<li> wrote a <a href="http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2016/06/16/pattern-basis-approach.html">math paper</a> on a proposed new approach to circuit complexity </li>
<li> implemented a 3d block-building interface, inspired by Minecraft but with enhancements for rapid building, using Python and Panda3d (used to make demo video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngss46yYhFI&list=PLfH2Gxm0_jzpj2UBFxSnWRjL_DhK4NPL4&index=2">3d colorpicker</a>) </li>
<li> smaller projects involving Python and graphics, like a simple open-source <a href="http://www.pyweek.org/e/Outlawn/">3d rolling-ball physics engine</a>
<!-- link to pyweek game for now; change to newer version (with enemy ball AIs) once it's on github or has a demo video -->
